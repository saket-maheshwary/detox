Automated Detection of Toxic Comments on the Web
================================================
The term “toxic comment” indicates a rude, disrespectful or an unreasonable comment that is likely to make you leave a discussion. It includes identity hate, insult, hate speech, profanity, threats, and various ethnic, racial, or homophobic slurs. Each category can be considered abusive, and these categories are not mutually exclusive. Our aim is to build a completely autonomous system to prevent such toxic comments from being posted.
